Hi, I’m @noah-owens

I’m interested in Stained Glass art and Website Development, and would love to learn more 
about data visualization in Py.

I’m currently learning principles of OOP in Java at school as a Business Informatics major
and self teaching PHP and SQL for a D&D 5e responsive website that will completely randomize every aspect of character creation.
